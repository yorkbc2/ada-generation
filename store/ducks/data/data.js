			To survive in a natural disaster, the main thing - it's not heroism, experts say. We must simply avoid the frivolous mistakes that we are inclined to do in the face of the threat of death.
			\"I will never forget this sound, it's a scratch of broken metal,\" says George Larson, a passenger of 440 Indian Airways, flying from Chennai in New Delhi in 1973.
			It was somewhere around 22:30, a thunderstorm raged on the side, and the plane was flying low.
			The tail of the machine hit the ground first. Larson threw himself out of the chair. But the plane moved on. The fuselage began to break into two halves, the electric cables sparkled, the passengers shouted.
			When Larson recovered, he saw that he was lying in a heap of metal scrap, and his legs were stuck. Soon under the wings of the aircraft began to explode fuel tanks.
			Larson washed up fragments, and he realized that he would have to save himself.
			\"The hot air burned the lungs, and it was very difficult to breathe,\" he recalls. But on the last breath he made a jerk, threw the wreckage, rolled out to the ground and fared at a safe distance.
			What a person feels when she hits lightning
			Of the 65 passengers and crew members, only 17 survived, and Larson is one of them.
			He really was very fortunate. Several minutes before the accident, he seriously violated the rules of safety. The man was sitting in the back row and communicated with the flight attendant. Suddenly, he unlatched his seatbelt for some reason, although the sign demanded not to do so.
			Most people who are not clinging to the disaster usually die.
			Larson also saved the fact that when the fire began, he was not lost, but made incredible effort and got out of the plane.
			Surprisingly, many people do not act quickly enough to save their lives before the death threat. They can argue for trifles when their ships drown, or stand calm on the beach, which is facing a tsunami.
			Psychologists have long known that in extreme circumstances, people often act at their own expense. Although the news usually talks about amazing cases of salvation, they often do not happen due to what people do, but contrary.
			\"Survival training teaches people not so much what to do during the disaster, but what to do\", explains John Leach, a psychologist at Leicester University who survived the fire at the London Kings Cross Underground Station in 1987.
			He says that in extreme circumstances, 80-90% of people do not do what they need.
			In the video of the Japanese earthquake in 2011 it is visible how people, at the risk of life, run in a supermarket for bottles with alcohol.
			And during a fire on board an airplane in Denver earlier this year, passengers were arrested for evacuation, as some people tried to make a sephi on the background of fire.
			Although such actions are contrary to common sense, people still repeat the same mistakes, even when they can cost life.
			So, what should be avoided in a situation that seriously threatens your life?
			STUPOR
			When we imagine a catastrophe, it seems to us that everyone falls into mass hysteria. Yes, at least, they depict natural disasters in films. But in reality, the most natural reaction of man to danger is inactivity.
			A policeman who tried to defraud the intruders during a recent terrorist attack on the London Bridge, said that people were frozen next to \"like deer in the light of car headlights.\"
			This reaction is so widespread that psychologists have invented the term for her - \"stress in a state of stress.\"
			This is not quite a passive reaction, as it may look from the outside. When our brain is paralyzed by fear, adrenaline gets into the bloodstream, and the muscles are tense, the \"primitive\" subconscious part of the mind sends a signal not to move from place.
			This mechanism - very common in the world of animals, from rats to rabbits, and, apparently, due to the last attempt to remain unnoticed.`,

			Actions in the conditions of man-made disasters

			 
			For example, one evening you came to the window to admire the event and saw ... My God! They saw a flare over a nearby enterprise. Fire, smoke, ashes rising to the sky, bloody reflections on the clouds. There were screaming dozens of fire sirens.

			Fire! Moreover, a catastrophic scale fire! What to do and what to not do to you in a similar situation? What exactly to not do is to call all relatives to admire the unusual, which happens, perhaps, once a hundred years, with a spectacle. Unfortunately, most often they make bored by the acute feelings of the inhabitants.

			They are assembled, lined up in several rows along the perimeter of the fire, as fans on the football arena, and wander on a possibly deadly dangerous accident for them. Look at the eyes of their own death and gossip about tomorrow, which, maybe, they will not be there anymore.

			This was the case in Chernobyl, where the family of nuclear power plant workers and NPP workers themselves (!) They watched the power unit fire all night and night without thinking about the consequences that it could have! This was the case during many other less well-known extraordinary events.

			In the conditions of technogenic accidents every empty curiosity is punished! Accidents are not circus performances and not sports competitions, and to approach them in terms of aesthetics is dangerous. Sometimes mortally dangerous. Here, unlike the spectacular event, the opposite is true - the farther away from the scene, the places are considered better. And the most expensive - on the remote from the scene for several kilometers galorets.

			At no lesser degree than an empty curiosity, it can hurt excessive calm. This is when a person learns about the event, closes the window, stops the curtains and goes to bed or continues to watch the TV in the belief that the fire should be handled by those who should do it. And he, as a disciplined taxpayer, has already contributed to his elimination in the form of paid taxes in time.

			Yes, it's likely that the firefighters will cope with the fire and without this, not as a calm citizen. But it is unlikely that they will be able to immediately eliminate the associated fires phenomena, which are expressed in the release of the environment of potent and toxic substances and poisoning adjacent to the site of the accident of the territories. By the way, the very ones on which this citizen lives.

			Hence the main, unified and self-reliant recommendation that can be given to people located near the site of a man-made accident is to do everything possible to get out of it as much as possible. And as soon as possible. Speed ​​and distance - here are two components that can protect a person from possible chemical and radiation damage.

			Quickly get together and run away! And it is better to overdo it in the assessment of danger than to underestimate it! What procedure can I recommend to people who fall into the defeat zone?

			! First and foremost - do not miss the warning information that is transmitted through many channels in the event of an accident - with the help of the siren of civil defense, factory and even electric horns, on television, radio, subscriber radio network, through ZhEKi and district policemen.

			If you've heard sirens - immediately turn on all receivers, TVs and subscriber speakers by setting them up to the local voice waves. And do not turn it off in the event of the transmission of emergency appeals, messages and recommendations. In any major accident, the headquarters of the local civil defense or regional rescue center, which is better than anyone or who knows what to do in such cases, immediately enters into the case.

			They will explain in detail to you what has happened and what you need to do in this regard. They provide delivery to the places of collection of vehicles and evacuation of people in advance of certain points. Therefore, if you do not want to go on foot, instead of riding on a bus with comfort, and to live in the open air, and not in some temporarily transferred refugees of the hotel, watch the air.

			 


			All recommendations of the headquarters of NGOs and rescuers must be carried out quickly and literally - what to do, what to wear, what to take with you, where to get ready for further evacuation ... And do not forget to pass all the information you know to your neighbors.

			In the event that the accident is obvious, and TVs and radios are silent, operate without waiting for official announcements and clarifications. Maybe they will not be at all, maybe this accident, as often happens with us, will prefer to simply silence for reasons of high secrecy. Or because of the fact that the local department of HO fears its high authorities fear more than a nuclear explosion.

			When declaring one or another degree of danger just in case of what they have heard, add an extra ball threat. According to the principle: I hear about a private accident - getting ready for the object, warned about the local - I'm preparing for the regional one. Here  \"porridge oil does not spoil! \"

			Do not be afraid to take responsibility for yourself! Do not wait for directions from above. Do not think about how you look, if suddenly it turns out that this is not an accident, but just some kind of small adventure. Do not be afraid to appear in someone else's eyes as a fool or a panicker. This is precisely the case when it's better to be a coward once than the whole life of a dead man.`,

		"info": `1. If you know a safe route and you can quickly leave a dangerous place - run away. Throw away your belongings and run away. Take other people with you. Warn the clashes about the threat. Stay as far away as possible from doors and windows. If the shooting started - put it on the ground, cover your head with your hands, turn away in the other direction. Do not move. If it's safe, try finding shelter. As soon as you get safe - call the police. If there is a counterterrorist operation, do not run in front of the intelligence officers so that they do not take you for the perpetrator. Go to them calmly, avoid sharp movements. Hold your hands so that they can be seen (the French recommend raising them) so that you will not be taken as a terrorist. 2. If you can not escape safely - hide yourself. Lean on the floor, if possible - away from windows, doorways and open spaces. Any storage facility is suitable, but if you can choose - look for a thick metal support or a solid wall (for example, thick concrete or made of several layers of brick). Remember that bullets penetrate glass, brick, wood and metal. Determine where there are exits close to your shelter. If it is possible and safe - barricade in the shelter, depart from the door (as recommended by the French). The British intelligence agencies are reminded that in any shelter it is important not to block their ways to retreat. Do not cry, turn off the sound and vibration on your mobile phone. If you are at home or indoors - turn off the light and disconnect all equipment that can make noise. 3. Choose yourself, or repulse terrorists. If you do not have special training - it is better not to "heroize". "In the absence of special training, do not try to neutralize the terrorists themselves, keep from the neighbors," warns the FSB. To attack the attacker only in the extreme case, if nothing else remains, advise the security department of the City Hall Houston. It is also worth finding items that can be used as weapons and to unite, if possible, with other people. 4. If you are taken hostage - do not resist. Try not to make noise and do not make sharp movements. Do not look at the criminals in your eyes, do not behave violently. Follow their requirements. If you need medical attention - talk calmly and briefly, do nothing until you get permission from the criminals. Watch and listen. Do not let your consciousness weaken: train memory, feel time. If it is possible and safe - do physical exercises. Find out the guards, whether you can read, write, use personal hygiene. Try to establish contact with terrorists. Do not discuss with other hostages the belongings of terrorists. In case the special services begin the operation on the release of hostages, lie on the floor with your face down, close your head with your hands and do not move. 5. As soon as you find yourself in safety - report what happened to the police. If you were among the hostages - remember the details of the attack in the smallest details. It will be important for the intelligence services to know exactly where the terrorists are, where you last saw them, how much they were, what they were wearing and what they were armed with. It is also important to convey information about the structure, whether inside the wounded, how many inside hostages, where there are entrances and exits. Do not report in social networks about the actions of special services, do not distribute rumors and unconfirmed information. Many attacks can be prevented due to the vigilance of citizens. If you found a suspicious item and the owner is not nearby - be sure to inform the police. Camouflage for explosive devices often serves ordinary bags, bags, boxes, toys. Do not touch, cut or move objects. Fix the detection time. Wait for the arrival of the police. Explain to children that suspicious items can be dangerous. Read the full text here:`,
